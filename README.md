# SQLCL

Oracle SQL Developer Command Line (SQLcl) is a free command line interface for
Oracle Database. It allows you to interactively or batch execute SQL and
PL/SQL. SQLcl provides in-line editing, statement completion, and command
recall for a feature-rich experience, all while also supporting your previously
written SQL\*Plus scripts.

## Installation

Clone the Repo in your home-folder under **~/.sqlcl/**.

```bash
make -p ~/.sqlcl
cd ~/.sqlcl
git clone https://github.com/guntherweissenbaeck/sqlcl.git .
```

The sqlcl-binary could be placed into the **~/.opt/sqlcl/** Folder.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.opt/.sqlcl/
```
